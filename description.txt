So I found expert mode easy after a while so I made a mod to make me rage quit. This mod works in normal mode and will stack with expert mode and any other similar mods. The effects are active when you have the mod enabled. With all that said, let's take a look at the actual changes.
All enemies now have:

1.5x Health
1.5x Damage
1.5x Defense
1.5x Knockback Resistance
1.5x Money Dropped
Natural Regeneration (stronger regen in hardmode)
Immunity to traps and lava

All vanilla bosses get additional attacks/changes
King Slime will shoot spikes
Eye of Cthulhu will shoot tears
Eater of Worlds head segments are double the size
Brain of Cthulhu creepers are 50% larger
Queen Bee will occasionally drop bee hives
Skeletron throws bones at you with his hands
Wall of Flesh alternates between shooting cursed flames and ichor from its mouth
The Twins will heal when the other one dies
The Destroyer and Probes are 250% bigger and the Destroyer's Head does 2x the damage
Skeletron Prime shoots lasers
Plantera's tentacles will block projectiles
The Detached Golem head can fire cultist fireballs and the Golem has insane life regen
Duke Fishron makes it rain deadly projectiles
Lunatic Cultist spawns "Shadow Clones" that shoot his projectiles
Moon Lord Core fires the same projectiles the Lunatic Cultist fires (shoots faster at half health)

You have a chance to get the bleeding debuff when damaged.

There are now poorly sprited biome cores which are accessories. They have a 1/500 chance to drop in their respective biome in hardmode. Each one increases a different stat and they can all be combined to create a powerful accessory.
